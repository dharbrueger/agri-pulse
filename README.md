## agri-pulse

This project is a data ingestion system that aggregates weather and soil moisture data, analyzes and visualizes the data, and give crop yield predictions.

### Data Ingestion

The system collects weather data from various sources, such as weather stations and meteorological APIs. It also gathers soil moisture data from sensors placed in agricultural fields.

### Crop Prediction Model

The system incorporates machine learning algorithms to train a crop prediction model. It uses historical weather data, soil moisture levels, and other factors to predict crop yields and identify potential risks.
